🚀 About the Project
==============

**Screen Dimming** is an Android application that places a dim color overlay across all apps to reduce brightness below the system minimum. It includes quick controls, notification actions, color filters, and safety mechanisms to avoid lockout.

* * *

✨ Features
----------

* 🌙 **System-Wide Dimming Overlay**: Adds a fullscreen dim color overlay over all apps using a foreground service.

* ☀️➡️🌙 **Animated Main Toggle**: Large round Sun/Moon control with smooth transition animation.

* 🎚️ **Intensity Control (0-99%)**: Adjustable dimming level with safety cap at 99%.

* 🔒 **Safety Protection**: 100% dimming is blocked to reduce risk of getting locked out.

* 👆 **Emergency Unlock Gesture**: Triple-tap in the top-right area to turn dimming off.

* 📳 **Haptic Emergency Feedback**: Triple-tap unlock gives clear vibration feedback.

* 🔔 **Notification Controls**: Change intensity (`-5%` / `+5%`) or turn dimming off directly from the notification panel.

* ⚙️ **Settings Screen**:

  * Overlay permission status + button to open system settings.

  * Notification permission status + button to grant/open system settings.

  * Color filter selection (Black, Warm, Red, Blue) with active selection highlight.

  * Language selection (English/German).

  * App Info dialog with version, developer, and action buttons.

* 🌍 **Bilingual UI**: Full English and German support.

* 🌑 **Forced Dark Theme**: App UI is locked to dark mode.

* 📱 **Portrait-Only UI**: Main and Settings screens stay in portrait orientation.
